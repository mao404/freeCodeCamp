# File Metadata Microservice

This is the boilerplate for the File Metadata Microservice project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice

## File Metadata Microservice

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

- Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
- Use our Gitpod starter project to complete your project.
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

**HINT**: You can use the `multer` npm package to handle file uploading.

## Tests

2. You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
3. The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.
4. When you submit a file, you receive the file `name`, `type`, and `size` in bytes within the JSON response.
