## File Metadata Microservice

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

2. You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
3. The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.
4. When you submit a file, you receive the file `name`, `type`, and `size` in bytes within the JSON response.
